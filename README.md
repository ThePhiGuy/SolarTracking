# Introduction
    This code is meant to help adapt a tilt system on a solar panel to use algorithmic solar tracking at Calvin University.

    We are still in very early stages of development, with the goal to finish out some of the smaller algorithims to increase accuracy,
    and to clean up and make code efficient. 

    This is purely a functional build meant to test functionality of algorithims, and is not meant for general use quite yet.

    Accuracy currently of all algorithims is within .1degrees of latitude on the sun, and expected completion accuracy is within .01degrees.
